Munder Difflin Paper Company

This project showcases our company, what we do, our products etc.

I started by creating a wireframe that would dictate how my page would look like. I ammended it multiple times during the course of the project as and when I updated anything.

I created a simple project that I was comfortable with and tried to use as many of the things I learned, as was possible. I Googled a lot of information, which was helpful but also received a lot of help.

Even though this was an initial project, I wanted to do my best and I felt that the time allocated was limited.
